## WHAT IS LOWPOLY

Low Poly, in fact, is made up of a triangular grid of shapes that alternate with each other to form folds and then form new geometric shapes. The sharp edges and abstract shapes of the polygons are very reminiscent of computer games from the 90s, in a retro style. When Low poly contains more triangles or polymorphs, it gives a more realistic and rather futuristic feel.

To achieve the visual effect of low poly, we first need to divide the multiple color elements in the form of triangles, and the color of each small triangle comes from the corresponding position of the original color element. Then the triangles are spaced and colored, that is, filled with pure color, and the three-dimensional effect is formed by the contrast of color shades and shadows.
